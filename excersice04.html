    <p>They are born tiny. They can not see and hear. They seek their mothers warmth. <img src="https://d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-86754-800.jpg" /> <strong>Do not separate kittens from their mother young</strong> This would be harmful to the kittens. They should be with them unitl 3 months old </p>
